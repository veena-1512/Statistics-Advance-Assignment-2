While not every variable follows a perfectly normal distribution, many real-life processes are often well-approximated by the normal distribution, especially when sample sizes are large.\n",

    "Simplicity and Predictability: The normal distribution is mathematically well-defined, which makes it analytically tractable. Its well-known properties and characteristics facilitate straightforward calculations and predictions in statistical analysis.\n",

    "Test Scores: In standardized testing, such as SAT or GRE exams, test scores often exhibit a normal distribution, especially when the sample size is large. The mean represents the average score, and the standard deviation reflects the spread of scores around that average.\n",

    "Measurement Errors: Errors in scientific measurements and experimental data often follow a normal distribution. For instance, if you measure the weight of an object multiple times, the errors in these measurements are likely to be normally distributed around the true value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Residuals in Regression Analysis: In linear regression analysis, the residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) are often assumed to follow a normal distribution. This assumption is crucial for valid statistical inference in regression models.\n",
